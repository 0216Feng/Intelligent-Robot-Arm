In the drawing process, we use a BPU node to replace this input type conversion process to ensure the correctness of the logical relationships expressed in the diagram, but in fact, this BPU node doesn't exist in the bin model.. We name this BPU node involved in the drawing process NV12TOYUV444 with details ['1x640x640x3 / 2, NV12, UINT8'].
